Layout:

SRC
- Contains relative benchmarks, libraries, and interfaces in c/c++
- Soon to contain a kernel...

SIM
- Contains gem5 simulator and relative scripts to run against different executables
- Contians lttng script to trace userspace or kernel events given a user space application

DOCS
- Contains project related research documents

TODOs:
Benchmarks
- Might need more than just fib to test against (i.e. add more benchmarks)

Simulation
- Create directory to redirect outputs from tracing/gem5 to start correlating results
into a centralized place
-- Also run different lttng combinations against benchmarks to gather more metrics
- Make a customized gem5 script to run against benchmarks

Analytics
- Roll out script to correlate metrics produced from simulations into csv & potentially graph results

Kernel
- Look into a suitable kernel to potentially look into improvements to make it more RT
-- Debian might be easier since its relatively small and easier to debug w/ when
making improvements (i.e. sideload onto raspberry pi)
