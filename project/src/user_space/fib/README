Threw this together... hopefully will be a useful example moving forward.

TODOS:
1) Double check process is pinning to core properly
2) Update high_prio programs to be actually running at highest prio.. right now they're just at norm
3) Put calc delta in a header to be shared accross other benchmarks (similar to affinity lib)
4) Add pthread lib
