Threw this together... hopefully will be a useful example moving forward.

TODOS:
1) Double check process is pinning to core properly

Explanation:
- Look through the code, fib can be setup in unicore or multicore environment ran at diff priorities.
- Don't pay too much attention to fib result, after sometime the result will be corrupted due to the 
space of int/uint, pay more attention to the timestamps after calculating fib.
- Context switching occurs when we're not creating a thread within our process context and setting it
to the highest priority (you get unpredictable response time)
- Stalling cpu with a sleep will cause more context switching.. try to stall away from these because of 
this... if you have to use a stall thats cool, just use the "stall_cpu" lib in inc I made
