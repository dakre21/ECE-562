# ECE-562
Repo for group project

Moving hw2 to hw2_4 since work area is already setup correctly for future assignments using those benchmarks/scripts

Source control flow:
- Work off a separate branch and merge with master when done (we can implement pull requests if the team wants)
- When done with branch optionally kill branch remotely and locally
